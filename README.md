# 🎯 Competitive Warfare

> *Asymmetric competitive strategy and "evil genius" business tactics for outmaneuvering rivals*

## What is this?

**Competitive Warfare** is a skill for AI agents (and humans) who want to think differently about competition. This isn't about playing nice—it's about understanding the psychology, strategy, and unconventional tactics that let smaller players beat giants, disrupt stagnant industries, and turn competitor strengths into weaknesses.

Inspired by military strategy, game theory, and real-world business warfare, this skill provides frameworks for:

- 🎪 **Disrupting stagnant industries** by breaking unwritten rules
- 🪤 **Setting competitive traps** that force rivals into lose-lose scenarios  
- 🎣 **Using bait strategies** (both offensive and defensive)
- ⚔️ **Fighting asymmetrically** against larger, better-funded competitors
- 🔴 **Red-team thinking** to anticipate and counter competitor moves

## 🧠 Core Mental Models

### Judo Strategy
*Use competitor's momentum against them*

Their size becomes bureaucracy. Their focus becomes blindness. Their commitments become shackles.

### The Cobra Effect
*Competitor solutions to your problems may backfire*

Create situations where their logical response creates worse problems.

### Death by a Thousand Cuts vs. Frontal Assassination
*Choose your warfare style based on resource differential*

Small players win through rapid iteration and attrition. Sometimes one decisive blow is better than gradual erosion.

## 🔥 The 4 Core Workflows

### 1. Industry Disruption Analysis
Map unwritten rules → Identify sacred cows → Find constraint violations → Calculate acceptable casualties

### 2. Competitive Trap Design
Find their rigid commitments → Create honey pot → Force lose-lose choice → Prepare counter-move

### 3. Bait Strategy
**Setting bait:** Make it visible, plausible, costly, and revealing

**Recognizing bait:** Ask what they want you to do, what your response reveals, and look for the real move

### 4. Asymmetric Move Generation
Find their cost of victory → Attack profit centers → Make strength = weakness → Change the rules

# Competitive Warfare

Asymmetric competitive strategy for outmaneuvering rivals through unconventional, creative, and psychologically-informed tactics.

## Core Workflows

### 1. Industry Disruption Analysis

When analyzing how to disrupt a stagnant industry:

1. **Map the unwritten rules** - What does everyone assume "must" be done?
2. **Identify sacred cows** - What are incumbents unwilling to change?
3. **Find constraint violations** - Which rules, if broken, create 10x advantage?
4. **Calculate acceptable casualties** - What pain will users accept for the upside?

**Questions to guide the analysis:**
- What do all competitors do identically that customers tolerate but don't love?
- Where is the industry optimizing for the wrong metric?
- What customer segment is being ignored because they're unprofitable under current models?
- What would happen if you removed a feature everyone thinks is essential?

### 2. Competitive Trap Design

When setting traps for competitors:

1. **Identify competitor's rigid commitments** - What can they NOT do without destroying their business model?
2. **Create the honey pot** - Offer something that looks valuable but exploits their rigidity
3. **Force the lose-lose choice** - Make any response damaging to them
4. **Prepare your counter-move** - Be ready to exploit whatever choice they make

**Trap Patterns** (see [references/trap-types.md](references/trap-types.md)):
- **Resource Sink** - Bait them into over-investing in low-value areas
- **Brand Dilution** - Force them to compromise their positioning
- **Innovator's Dilemma Trap** - Create a low-end threat they can't respond to without cannibalizing
- **Speed Trap** - Force rushed decisions that reveal weaknesses

### 3. Bait Strategy (Offensive & Defensive)

**Setting Bait:**
1. Make it visible - Competitors need to see it
2. Make it plausible - They must believe responding is rational
3. Make it costly - Their response drains resources or commits them
4. Make it revealing - Their response exposes their strategy/capabilities

**Recognizing & Exploiting Competitor Bait:**
1. Ask: "What are they trying to get me to do?"
2. Ask: "What does my response reveal about me?"
3. Consider: Non-response, delayed response, or counter-bait
4. Look for the real move behind the bait

See [references/bait-strategies.md](references/bait-strategies.md) for detailed bait patterns.

### 4. Asymmetric Move Generation

When competing against larger/better-funded rivals:

1. **Find their cost of victory** - Where is winning expensive for them?
2. **Attack where they monetize** - Hit their profit centers, not their loss leaders
3. **Make their strength a weakness** - Their scale = bureaucracy; their focus = blindspots
4. **Change the rules** - Move to a game they can't win or won't play

See [references/asymmetric-moves.md](references/asymmetric-moves.md) for tactic catalog.

## Mental Models

**Judo Strategy:** Use competitor's momentum against them. Their size, speed, or commitments become vulnerabilities.

**Speed of Iteration vs. Quality of Iteration:** Small players win by learning faster, not by being perfect.

**The Cobra Effect:** Competitor solutions to problems you create may backfire on them.

**Frontal Assassination vs. Death by a Thousand Cuts:** Choose between decisive blow or gradual erosion based on your resource differential.

**Red Team Thinking:** Assume competitor is smart and malicious. What would YOU do to destroy your own business?

## Output Format

When generating competitive ideas, structure output as:

1. **Situation Analysis** - Current competitive landscape and constraints
2. **Asymmetric Opportunities** - 3-5 unconventional angles
3. **Specific Tactics** - Actionable moves with expected competitor responses
4. **Counter-Response Planning** - How they'll likely respond, and your next move
5. **Risk Assessment** - Downside scenarios and mitigation

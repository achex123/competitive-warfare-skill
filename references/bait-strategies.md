# Bait Strategies

Offensive bait (setting traps) and defensive bait recognition (avoiding traps).

## Part 1: Setting Effective Bait

### The Bait Formula

Effective bait must be VISIBLE + PLAUSIBLE + COSTLY + REVEALING.

**Visible:** They have to notice it. Stealth bait is wasted bait.

**Plausible:** They must believe responding is rational. Unbelievable bait is ignored.

**Costly:** Their response must drain resources or commit them. Free responses aren't traps.

**Revealing:** Their response exposes their strategy, capabilities, or intentions.

### Bait Pattern 1: The Fake Pivot

**What it looks like:** Publicly announce (or leak) that you're pivoting to a new market/feature that threatens them.

**Why it works:** Forces them to prepare for a threat that may never materialize.

**Implementation:**
- Beta program in their core market
- Job postings for skills in their domain
- Patent filings in their area
- Conference talks about "exciting new direction"

**Cost to them:** Resources diverted to competitive intelligence, strategic planning, possible pre-emptive moves.

**Reveal:** Their response shows what they fear most, where they're vulnerable.

**Example:** Cloud startup leaks plans for enterprise features. Incumbent enterprise vendor accelerates downmarket moves, revealing insecurity about their position.

### Bait Pattern 2: The Honey Pot Market

**What it looks like:** Aggressively pursue a customer segment that looks attractive but is actually a trap.

**Why it works:** They can't let you have it without a fight, but fighting drains resources from profitable segments.

**Implementation:**
- Price aggressively in a specific segment
- Loud marketing campaigns targeting their core demographic
- Feature development for that segment

**Cost to them:** Price matching (margin destruction), marketing spend, feature bloat.

**Reveal:** Which customers they consider most valuable vs. which they're willing to lose.

**Example:** Target the "enterprise lite" segment. They either lose face by not defending, or over-serve unprofitable customers.

### Bait Pattern 3: The Partnership Mirage

**What it looks like:** Feign interest in partnership that would benefit them, then pull back or delay.

**Why it works:** They slow down other initiatives waiting for partnership that never comes.

**Implementation:**
- Express enthusiastic interest in partnership
- Request detailed proposals/data (they invest effort)
- Go silent or move slowly
- Occasionally resurface to keep hope alive

**Cost to them:** Executive attention, business development resources, delayed competing moves.

**Reveal:** Their strategic priorities (what partnerships they want), their desperation level.

**Example:** Hint at distribution partnership. They pause direct sales efforts while waiting, giving you runway.

### Bait Pattern 4: The Talent Signal

**What it looks like:** Heavy recruiting in specific skill areas to suggest strategic direction.

**Why it works:** They adjust their hiring/strategy based on where they think you're going.

**Implementation:**
- Job postings for specific technologies
- Conference talks by your team on specific topics
- Patent applications in specific areas

**Cost to them:** Misallocated hiring resources, potentially wrong strategic bets.

**Reveal:** What technology directions they take seriously vs. dismiss.

**Example:** Post jobs for AR/VR engineers. Competitor over-invests in AR while you focus elsewhere.

---

### Bait Pattern 5: The Pricing Riddle

**What it looks like:** Unusual pricing structure that requires them to figure out your unit economics.

**Why it works:** They spend resources analyzing/modeling your business instead of improving theirs.

**Implementation:**
- Bundled pricing that obscures component costs
- Usage-based pricing with complex tiers
- Freemium with unclear conversion funnel

**Cost to them:** Analyst time, strategy sessions, pricing strategy re-work.

**Reveal:** How they think about pricing strategy, what they assume about your margins.

**Example:** Complex usage tiers. They model your business obsessively while you iterate on product.

## Part 2: Recognizing Competitor Bait

### Warning Signs You're Being Baited

**Sign 1: The Move Doesn't Make Sense for Them**
- "Why would they do this? It's not profitable/strategic for them."
- Answer: It might not be about profit; it might be about getting you to do something.

**Sign 2: It's Too Visible**
- Real strategic moves are often stealthy.
- Extremely public moves may be theater.

**Sign 3: It Targets Your Known Weaknesses**
- They're attacking exactly where you're insecure.
- This may be to trigger overreaction, not to win that battle.

**Sign 4: The Timeline is Artificially Urgent**
- "Respond by X date or lose opportunity"
- Real opportunities don't expire on press release schedules.

**Sign 5: It's Uncharacteristic**
- They've never done this type of move before.
- Sudden strategy shifts may be bait, not real strategy.

### The Bait Response Framework

When you suspect bait, analyze through this lens:

**Question 1: What are they trying to get me to do?**
- Spend money?
- Reveal capabilities?
- Delay a move?
- Change positioning?
- Overextend resources?

**Question 2: What does my response reveal about me?**
- Do I have the capability they suspect?
- How much does this threat worry me?
- What's my timeline?
- What's my resource situation?

**Question 3: What happens if I don't respond?**
- Is the threat real enough to matter?
- Will silence be interpreted as weakness?
- Can I afford to cede this ground?

**Question 4: Can I counter-bait?**
- Their bait reveals something about their priorities.
- Can I exploit that information?

### Counter-Bait Strategies

**Strategy 1: The Non-Response**
- Simply ignore the bait.
- Best when: Bait is obvious, your position is strong, responding reveals too much.
- Risk: Silence can be interpreted as weakness or confirmation.

**Strategy 2: The Delayed Response**
- "We're evaluating this."
- Use the time to study their pattern and prepare better move.
- Best when: You need information, bait is partially credible.

**Strategy 3: The Category Shift**
- Don't respond to the bait; change the subject.
- "While they're focused on X, we're doubling down on Y."
- Best when: You have differentiation in different dimension.

**Strategy 4: The Over-Response**
- Respond so aggressively they can't afford to continue the bait strategy.
- Best when: You have resource advantage and want to end the game quickly.
- Risk: Expensive, may be what they wanted (resource drain).

**Strategy 5: The Reveal**
- Publicly call out the bait.
- "Competitor X is clearly trying to get us to..."
- Best when: Bait is obvious and calling it out damages their credibility.
- Risk: Can look defensive or paranoid.

## Part 3: Bait Escalation Ladder

Understanding the sophistication of bait helps you respond appropriately.

**Level 1: Obvious Bait**
- Direct attacks on your weaknesses.
- Easy to spot, easy to ignore.
- Response: Usually non-response is fine.

**Level 2: Disguised Bait**
- Looks like normal competitive move but serves secondary purpose.
- Requires some analysis to detect.
- Response: Delayed response with investigation.

**Level 3: Multi-Layer Bait**
- Bait that, if called out, serves different purpose.
- If you ignore: they gain position. If you respond: you reveal info. If you call it out: you look paranoid.
- Response: Requires sophisticated counter-move.

**Level 4: Meta-Bait**
- Bait designed to be recognized as bait, but the "real" trap is elsewhere.
- They want you to think you're being smart by avoiding obvious trap.
- Response: Question your own analysis; consider what you're NOT seeing.

## Part 4: Ethical Boundaries

While this skill focuses on competitive tactics, consider:

- **Legal compliance:** Bait involving false statements, fraud, or market manipulation is illegal.
- **Industry norms:** Some industries have explicit or implicit competitive norms.
- **Reputation risk:** Being known as manipulative can harm recruiting, partnerships, and customer trust.
- **Reciprocity:** Tactics you use may be used against you.

Use creative competitive thinking to find advantages, not to engage in genuinely harmful deception.

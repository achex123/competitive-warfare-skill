# Competitive Trap Types

Catalog of trap patterns for asymmetric competitive warfare.

## 1. Resource Sink Trap

**Objective:** Bait competitor into over-investing in low-value areas, draining resources from core competencies.

**How it works:**
- Identify a feature/segment that looks important but has low ROI
- Publicly commit heavily to it (or appear to)
- Force competitor to match or exceed your "investment"
- They burn cash/time; you pivot to what actually matters

**Examples:**
- Feature war in a category users don't actually care about
- Price war in low-margin customer segments
- Geographic expansion to costly markets
- "Innovation" in commoditized features

**Signals it's working:**
- Competitor announces matching investments
- Their core product stagnates while they chase your bait
- Industry analysts praise the "race" you're both in

**Counter-Strategy:**
- Ask: "Are we chasing this because it's valuable, or because they are?"
- Calculate independent ROI, not competitive response ROI
- Publicly cede the category while dominating what matters

## 2. Brand Dilution Trap

**Objective:** Force competitor to compromise their market position to respond to you.

**How it works:**
- Attack a segment they serve but don't own
- Force them to defend with messaging/tactics that conflicts with their core brand
- Their core audience loses faith while new audience doesn't fully adopt

**Examples:**
- Luxury brand forced to compete on price → loses prestige
- Enterprise SaaS launching "simple" version → confuses positioning
- Premium brand going mass-market → alienates core customers
- Technical tool making "easy" version → experts lose respect

**Signals it's working:**
- Their messaging becomes contradictory
- Core customers complain about "selling out"
- They need separate branding to avoid damage (confirms trap)

**Counter-Strategy:**
- Accept the loss in attacked segment rather than compromise brand
- Launch separate sub-brand with clear differentiation
- Double down on core positioning and cede the attacked segment

## 3. Innovator's Dilemma Trap

**Objective:** Create a low-end disruption they cannot respond to without destroying their core business.

**How it works:**
- Identify over-served customers paying for features they don't use
- Offer "good enough" solution at fraction of the price
- Incumbent cannot match without cannibalizing high-margin business
- You capture bottom of market, then move upmarket over time

**Examples:**
- Discount airline vs. legacy carriers (hub-and-spoke model prevents response)
- SaaS startup offering core features only vs. bloated enterprise suite
- Direct-to-consumer vs. retail brands (channel conflict)
- Open source vs. proprietary software

**Key insight:** Their business model is the trap, not their product.

**Signals it's working:**
- They ignore you ("not our customer segment")
- They create separate low-end brand (validates threat)
- They discount premium product (damages margins)

**Counter-Strategy:**
- Acquire the disruptor early
- Create genuinely separate business unit (different brand, P&L, team)
- Accept cannibalization as better than disruption

## 4. Speed Trap

**Objective:** Force rushed decisions that reveal weaknesses or commit them to suboptimal paths.

**How it works:**
- Create time pressure through rapid moves or artificial deadlines
- Force them to respond before full analysis
- Their rushed response exposes strategy or creates mistakes
- You prepared; they reacted

**Examples:**
- Rapid feature releases they must match
- Surprise partnership announcements
- Aggressive PR campaigns requiring immediate response
- "Deadline" deals for customers

**Implementation:**
- Prepare your moves in secret
- Execute multiple simultaneously
- Have your next 2-3 moves ready before you start

**Signals it's working:**
- Their response is inconsistent or contradictory
- They change pricing/features frequently
- Internal leaks suggest internal disagreement on response

**Counter-Strategy:**
- Refuse to play their timeline ("we'll respond when ready")
- Use the delay to study their pattern; they're revealing hand
- Pre-empt with your own timeline announcements

## 5. Platform Dependency Trap

**Objective:** Make them dependent on your platform/ecosystem, then change terms.

**How it works:**
- Offer attractive partnership terms to build their business on your platform
- Once locked in, become less cooperative
- Their business now depends on you; they have no leverage

**Examples:**
- App stores taking larger cuts over time
- API providers changing pricing after developers build on them
- Marketplace platforms launching competing products
- Platform algorithm changes affecting dependent businesses

**Ethical note:** This can backfire spectacularly if perceived as abusive. Use with caution.

**Counter-Strategy:**
- Never be 100% dependent on any single platform
- Build direct customer relationships alongside platform presence
- Maintain technical ability to switch platforms

---

## 6. Standards Trap

**Objective:** Get them to adopt a standard you control, then use that control.

**How it works:**
- Create or co-opt an industry standard
- Get competitors to adopt it (compatibility, customer demand)
- Once adopted, you control evolution of the standard
- They follow your roadmap or break compatibility

**Examples:**
- File formats controlled by one vendor
- Protocol standards with reference implementations you own
- Certification programs you administer
- "Open" standards with key IP you control

**Counter-Strategy:**
- Participate in truly neutral standards bodies
- Maintain ability to translate/compete standards
- Don't adopt until standard is genuinely multi-party governed

## 7. Talent Vacuum Trap

**Objective:** Drain their critical talent without them realizing the strategic impact.

**How it works:**
- Identify their key personnel in strategic areas
- Target specifically for recruitment (not general hiring)
- Each departure amplifies the impact of the next
- They lose institutional knowledge and execution capability

**Examples:**
- Hiring their top engineers in a specific technology
- Recruiting their key account executives
- Acquiring small teams that have critical knowledge

**Implementation:**
- Make your company visibly attractive to their talent
- Target specific roles that compound in impact
- Be public enough about hires to damage their morale

**Counter-Strategy:**
- Never have single points of failure (bus factor > 1)
- Document institutional knowledge obsessively
- Build loyalty through non-monetary factors (mission, autonomy)

## 8. Regulatory Trap

**Objective:** Use regulatory environment to create costs for them you don't bear.

**How it works:**
- Identify regulations they must comply with that you (structurally) avoid
- Accelerate regulatory scrutiny in their direction
- They bear compliance costs; you remain agile

**Examples:**
- Being too small to be regulated while they're large
- Different legal jurisdiction with favorable rules
- Different business model (marketplace vs. employer)
- Open-source vs. proprietary (liability differences)

**Implementation:**
- Stay just under regulatory thresholds
- Structure specifically to avoid certain classifications
- Use their regulatory burden in your marketing

**Counter-Strategy:**
- Support smart regulation that raises barriers for new entrants
- Structure to minimize regulatory surface area
- Invest heavily in regulatory relationships/flexibility

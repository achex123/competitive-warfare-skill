# Asymmetric Move Catalog

Tactics for competing when you're smaller, less funded, or otherwise disadvantaged.

## 1. Attack Their Profit Center

**Principle:** Hit where they make money, not where they spend money.

**Why it works:** Large competitors often use profitable areas to subsidize competitive battles elsewhere. If you threaten their profits, they must choose between defending revenue or continuing to attack you.

**Tactics:**
- Identify their highest-margin products/customers
- Offer direct alternative specifically for that segment
- Price aggressively enough to threaten their margin structure
- Force them to either lose margin or lose market share

**Example:** Startup targets only the Fortune 500 segment of an enterprise SaaS giant's customer base, offering equivalent service at 60% cost.

**Risk:** If you fail to win those customers, you've burned resources with nothing to show.

## 2. Change the Evaluation Criteria

**Principle:** If they're winning on their metrics, change the metrics.

**Why it works:** Incumbents optimize for the current game. Changing the rules forces them to re-tool while you start optimized for the new rules.

**Tactics:**
- Introduce new dimension of comparison (ease of use vs. features, speed vs. cost)
- Create new category you can own
- Reframe what "good" means (sustainable vs. cheap, simple vs. powerful)
- Make their strengths irrelevant to the new criteria

**Example:** Dell changed PC buying from "best specs" to "configure exactly what you need online." Competitors optimized for retail shelf space couldn't compete.

**Implementation:**
1. Identify dimension where you win or can win
2. Marketing/education campaign about why that dimension matters
3. Product optimization for that dimension
4. Frame competitor as optimized for wrong thing

## 3. The Unbundling Strategy

**Principle:** Their bundle has waste; offer only what customers actually use.

**Why it works:** Large competitors create bloated products to serve all customers. Most users only need 20% of features.

**Tactics:**
- Identify most-used 20% of features in their product
- Build only those features, perfectly executed
- Price at fraction of their cost (still profitable due to lower complexity)
- Target customers who feel over-served

**Example:** Salesforce is a suite; point solutions (Calendly, Zoom, Airtable) unbundled specific features and won those categories.

**Advanced:** After winning with unbundled solution, gradually add features to move upmarket.

---

## 4. The Unfair Data Advantage

**Principle:** Find data sources they can't or won't access.

**Why it works:** Data creates network effects and product advantages. Unique data sources create durable differentiation.

**Tactics:**
- Build on new platforms before they notice (new social networks, APIs)
- Aggregate data from sources competitors ignore
- Create data through your product usage that improves the product (true network effects)
- Use permissive data sources they avoid due to brand risk

**Example:** Clearbit built proprietary data graph from public sources before incumbents considered it viable.

---

## 5. Speed as Strategy

**Principle:** Make decisions faster than they can respond.

**Why it works:** Large organizations optimize for correctness; small ones can optimize for speed. In uncertain environments, fast learning beats slow optimization.

**Tactics:**
- Release features weekly vs. their quarterly cycles
- A/B test everything; let data decide faster than their committees
- Pivot quickly when something doesn't work
- Change pricing/models faster than they can get approval

**Key insight:** Your cost of being wrong is lower. Use that advantage.

**Warning:** Speed without learning is just thrashing. Measure and iterate.

---

## 6. The Ecosystem Play

**Principle:** Build alliances they can't match due to their position.

**Why it works:** Large incumbents often have ecosystem conflicts. They're competing with potential partners, making true alliances impossible.

**Tactics:**
- Identify companies who fear/hate your common competitor
- Build integrations that make your combined offering stronger
- Create standards or platforms that attract ecosystem
- Position as "Switzerland" while they're an empire

**Example:** Microsoft under Ballmer couldn't build iOS apps; competitors could. Google's Android strategy against iOS.

---

## 7. The Regulatory Arbitrage

**Principle:** Use structural advantages in regulatory environment.

**Why it works:** Regulations often favor small/new entrants or create compliance costs that scale with size.

**Tactics:**
- Stay under regulatory thresholds (employee count, revenue)
- Structure to avoid certain classifications (contractor vs. employee, platform vs. publisher)
- Operate in jurisdictions with favorable rules
- Use regulations as moat once you understand them better

**Example:** Airbnb operated in regulatory gray areas hotels couldn't; built scale before regulations caught up.

**Warning:** Regulatory arbitrage is temporary. Eventually regulations catch up or change.

---

## 8. The Channel Inversion

**Principle:** Go direct when they use intermediaries (or vice versa).

**Why it works:** Different channels have different economics. Inverting the channel can create structural advantages.

**Tactics:**
- **Direct-to-consumer** when they use retail/distributors (capture margin)
- **Marketplace/platform** when they use direct sales (aggregate demand)
- **Self-serve** when they use enterprise sales (lower CAC)
- **Enterprise sales** when they only have self-serve (capture high-value customers)

**Example:** Warby Parker (DTC) vs. Luxottica (retail). Dollar Shave Club (subscription) vs. Gillette (retail).

---

## 9. The Feature-Not-Product Strategy

**Principle:** Be a feature they can't add without destroying their product.

**Why it works:** Sometimes the best position is inside their product, not competing with it.

**Tactics:**
- Build as platform/extension on top of their product
- Be "the X for [their product]"
- Create value they can't capture without undermining their core
- Become essential to their users, then negotiate from strength

**Example:** Grammarly works everywhere; Microsoft can't build Word-only equivalent without being accused of anti-competitive behavior.

**Risk:** Platform risk. They can change APIs, build competing features, or acquire you (cheap or expensive depending on timing).

---

## 10. The Positioning Mirage

**Principle:** Look like a different category until it's too late.

**Why it works:** Competitors ignore threats that don't look like competition. By the time they realize, you've built position.

**Tactics:**
- Use different language/category entirely
- Target adjacent market first
- Build features that don't overlap initially
- Gradually converge over time

**Example:** Netflix (DVD rental by mail) → Netflix (streaming) → Netflix (original content). Each phase looked different from previous competition.

**Warning:** Requires long-term vision and patience. Hard to execute if funding requires showing competitive wins early.

---

## 11. The Commoditization Play

**Principle:** Make their differentiation table stakes, compete on something else.

**Why it works:** They invested heavily in differentiating features. Open sourcing or free alternatives removes that advantage.

**Tactics:**
- Open-source their proprietary technology
- Free offerings at their paid tier level
- Make their "advanced" features industry standard
- Shift competition to dimension where you win

**Example:** Android commoditized mobile OS; Google wins on services. MongoDB open-sourced database; wins on managed service.

---

## 12. The Talent Arbitrage

**Principle:** Access talent pools they ignore or can't utilize.

**Why it works:** Large companies optimize for credential signals. Great talent exists outside their filters.

**Tactics:**
- Hire based on work samples, not credentials
- Geographic arbitrage (talent outside tech hubs)
- Remote-first when they require office
- Non-traditional backgrounds (bootcamps, self-taught)
- Part-time/fractional executives they wouldn't consider

**Example:** Automattic (WordPress) built on 100% remote when all competitors required SF/NYC presence.

---

## 13. The Anti-Brand

**Principle:** Build identity around everything they're not.

**Why it works:** Every brand choice excludes some customers. Their choices create opportunities for opposite positioning.

**Tactics:**
- Identify what their brand represents (corporate, complex, expensive)
- Build opposite brand (fun, simple, accessible)
- Attract customers they exclude by design
- Make their very existence validate your positioning

**Example:** Apple (creative, different) vs. IBM (corporate, standard). Robinhood (democratizing) vs. traditional brokers (exclusive).

---

## 14. The Integration Advantage

**Principle:** Be the connective tissue between tools they can't integrate.

**Why it works:** Large companies optimize for internal integration. They struggle to play well with others.

**Tactics:**
- Build best-in-class integrations with many tools
- Be the "hub" they can't be due to conflicts
- Aggregate data across platforms they compete with
- Solve multi-tool workflows they can't solve (organizational boundaries)

**Example:** Zapier integrates everything; Salesforce can't build best-in-class integrations with competitors.

## Choosing Your Asymmetric Moves

Not all moves fit all situations. Select based on:

1. **Your resources** - Don't pick speed if you're slow; don't pick ecosystem if you're isolated
2. **Their structure** - Attack where their size is actually a disadvantage
3. **Market timing** - Some moves only work in specific market phases
4. **Your strengths** - Pick moves that leverage what you do well

**The best asymmetric move is often the one they can't respond to even if they see it coming.**
